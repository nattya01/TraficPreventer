# Business questions 
7-9.
	Business questions 
	1)	Places or district in the US likely to be susceptible to more crashes – insurance company interest.
	2)	The police and the medical units weak places – zones where they don't respond fast.
	3)	 The roads authority in the US – which signs on the way and in which places are more crash "inviting"?
	4)	Analyzing intersect crashes alone and to suggest a model on how to build safer intersect or where is the dangers places around the intersect?
	Who (hypothetically) needs to review your business questions before you analyze?
	I think that the best person to review our business question is our target client; maybe what we think as a good business question is not question at all.
